# SVG Logo Maker
  ## About Application
  This application is a SVG logo maker that accepts user input to dynamically create a custom SVG. By using 'node index.js' the user can call the app and begin creating their own SVG. The user will first be prompted for 3 text characters they would like to be displayed, following up with the text's color. After doing so, the program will then ask to select a shape from a list of, trinagle, circle and square. Finally, it will ask for the color that will fill in the shape. Once, all prompts have been answered a 'logo.svg' file will be dynamically created and the custom svg will be populated within the file.
